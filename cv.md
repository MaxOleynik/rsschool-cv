## About me

Hello, my name is Maxim and I am 29 years old. I study front-end development and enjoy this field because it combines technology with creativity in design. I am motivated by the results of my work and the possibility to create something new.

In addition to studying, I also have a hobby â€“ playing guitar. Music has always been an important part of my life, providing a way to relax and unwind after a hard day. Combining my hobbies and studies allows me to take a break from challenging tasks and approach them later with a fresh perspective, as well as helps me maintain motivation.
